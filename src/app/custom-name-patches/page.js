            <p>
              Custom name patches are a stylish and practical way to personalise
              uniforms, gear, or clothing. With options such as iron-on backing,
              plastic, no backing, hook and loop, or adhesive, you can choose
              the most suitable attachment method for your needs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Embroidered name patches offer a classic look with overlocked
              merrowed borders and colourfast threads, designed to withstand
              harsh washing. Alternatively, dye-sublimated name patches provide
              unlimited colours and intricate detail without the risk of
              fraying.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ideal for businesses, clubs, and uniforms, these high-quality
              custom patches ensure clear identification while representing your
              brand or team with precision and style.
