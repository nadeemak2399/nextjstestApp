                <p>The artwork we send is the final depiction of your design; therefore, it is your responsibility to thoroughly check it to ensure it meets your instructions. You are responsible for proofreading any text and verifying colours, threads, and other design elements.</p>

                <p>Once you approve the artwork, you must email it back to us with a note confirming your approval. After placing the order, refunds will not be issued under any circumstances.

                <p>We ship internationally. However, <strong>free shipping is only available for orders within the USA</strong>. International customers will be charged shipping fees and are solely responsible for any customs duties or taxes.</p>

                <span><strong>Returns</strong></span>

                <p>If there is a <strong>manufacturing defect</strong> or if the final product does not match the approved artwork, you must notify us <strong>within 7 days</strong> of receiving the order. If the issue is due to our error, we will reproduce your patches at no additional cost and resend them.</p>

                <span><strong>Payments</strong></span>
